# Dave C.  
### Senior Game Producer • Technical Producer • QA Leader  
**I turn ambitious ideas into shipped products — repeatedly, under pressure.**

## 👋 Hi, I’m Dave

I’m a senior production leader with deep experience across **game development, live operations, QA, and technical delivery**.  
I work at the uncomfortable but valuable intersection of **design, engineering, QA, and business**, where things either ship—or quietly fall apart.

My specialty is making sure they ship.

## 🧠 What I’m Known For

- Turning creative vision into executable plans
- Building production and QA systems that scale
- Reducing risk early instead of apologizing late
- Leading distributed teams without micromanagement
- Bringing order to complex, fast-moving pipelines

If a project is behind, unclear, or on fire, I’m usually brought in to stabilize it.

## 🎯 How I Evaluate Fit

I don’t believe in vague roles or generic outreach.

I’m most effective when:
- Ownership is real
- Shipping matters
- Tradeoffs are explicit
- Teams value clarity over theater

If you need someone to **run meetings**, I’m not your hire.  
If you need someone to **own delivery and make hard things predictable**, I probably am.

Just experience, outcomes, and whether the boxes actually line up.
