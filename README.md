**I ship complex products without drama.**

## 👋 Hi, I’m Dave

I’m a senior production leader with a bias toward **execution, clarity, and outcomes**.  
I’ve spent my career sitting at the intersection of **design, engineering, QA, and live operations**—turning ambitious ideas into shipped, scalable products.

I specialize in:
- High-complexity pipelines
- Live/F2P games and SaaS-like systems
- Distributed teams
- “This is on fire, please help” situations

If it involves uncertainty, deadlines, and a lot of moving parts, I’m probably comfortable there.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do Well

- **Translate vision into reality**  
  Turning design intent into work that engineers, artists, and QA all interpret the same way.

- **Build production systems that scale**  
  Roadmaps, backlogs, pipelines, and rituals that survive contact with reality.

- **De-risk delivery**  
  Spot problems early, make tradeoffs explicit, and keep teams shipping instead of spiraling.

- **Lead without micromanaging**  
  Clear goals, strong ownership, zero babysitting.

## 🛠 Tools I’ve Used (and Lived In)

Jira • Confluence • Jenkins • TestRail • Unity • GitHub • CI/CD pipelines  
Agile / Scrum / Kanban (used pragmatically, not religiously)

## 🔍 How I Think About Fit

I don’t believe in vague roles or generic outreach.

I work best when:
- The problem is clear (or at least honestly unclear)
- Ownership matters
- Shipping matters more than theater

If you’re looking for someone to **“manage tasks”**, I’m not your guy.  
If you need someone to **own delivery**, reduce risk, and help teams move faster *without breaking*, we should probably talk.
